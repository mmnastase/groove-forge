### Builder
- Starts with a blank project and auto-adds a pinned Timing widget.
- Use the Add Widget bar to add a Metronome (more widgets coming).
- Reorder or remove widgets using the hover controls on each widget.

### Timing Widget
- Controls project tempo (BPM) and time signature (e.g., 4/4, 7/8, 13/16).
- Tempo slider has high contrast and updates sound live as you drag.
- Time signature inputs accept empty state, so you can delete and retype seamlessly; values apply on blur or when valid.

### Metronome Widget
- Uses the project BPM and time signature to generate clicks.
- Grid is derived from the current signature to provide musical subdivisions (e.g., 4/4 → 16th grid, 12/8 → 8th grouping).
- Click the step bars to set accent levels (0 subtle, 1 medium, 2 strong). Changes apply instantly.
- Presets available: Quarter feel, Eighth feel, Bar only.
