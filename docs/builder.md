## Builder

The Builder is the main workspace where you assemble your project from modular widgets.

### Features

- Add widgets via the Add Widget bar.
- Reorder and remove widgets with inline controls (hover to reveal).
- Project state (widgets and time signature) persists to localStorage.

### Planned
- Persistence per-widget (e.g., Metronome accent patterns).
- Project export/import.
- Grouping, sections, and arrangement.
